apalachee high school student arrested for allegedly bringing gun to campus months after deadly mass shooting,Officers arrested the 14-year-old Apalachee High School student without incident.,2025-01-10T16:38:23Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/10/us-news/apalachee-high-school-student-arrested-for-allegedly-bringing-gun-to-campus-months-after-deadly-mass-shooting/,The Barrow County Sheriff’s Office said a 14-year-old student was arrested Wednesday after he allegedly brought a gun to Apalachee High School the same Georgia school where two students and two teachers were killed in a mass shooting in September. At approximately 2:02 p.m. school resource officers arrested the student without incident. “The student was cooperative and compliant when encountered by law enforcement officers and there have been no reports of the student threatening anyone with the gun” the sheriff’s office said. The boy who was not named due to his age has since been transported to a youth detention center. The boy was charged with theft being a minor in possession of a gun and possessing a weapon on school grounds.  Officials didn’t say what type of gun was seized or how the child acquired the gun. In response to the incident the Barrow County School System canceled Thursday’s classes at the high school and called for a meeting to discuss immediate safety enhancement options. “We understand this brings up many different feelings in each of us” the school system said. “We will update you all following the board meeting tomorrow with any changes regarding school procedures.”  On Sept. 4 14-year-old student Colt Gray allegedly opened fire at Apalachee High School killing two teachers and two students. Teachers Richard Aspinwall 39 and Cristina Irimie 53 and students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo both 14 were killed. Gray has since been indicted on 55 counts as an adult including 25 counts of aggravated assault. He has pleaded not guilty and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole or life with the possibility of parole if convicted. His father Colin Gray who was arrested and charged with buying the semiautomatic AR-15-style rifle used in the shooting and giving it to Colt for Christmas is facing 29 counts including two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of involuntary manslaughter. He has also pleaded not guilty.  Georgia is one of 42 states in the U.S. that holds parents criminally responsible for their children.
california man alexander paffendorf apologizes for connection to wisconsin school shooting — without detailing his actions,Alexander Paffendorf expressed regret for his involvement when a judge offered a chance for final words before keeping an order to confiscate his guns and ammunition in place until April 4.,2025-01-04T06:15:16Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/04/us-news/california-man-alexander-paffendorf-apologizes-for-connection-to-wisconsin-abundant-life-christian-school-shooter-natalie-rupnow/, A California man apologized Friday for his connection to a 15-year-old girl who fatally shot a teacher and fellow student at a religious school in Wisconsin telling a judge that he was prepared to accept the consequences of his actions without explaining his precise role. Alexander Paffendorf expressed regret for his involvement when a judge offered a chance for final words before keeping an order to confiscate his guns and ammunition in place until April 4. He didn’t elaborate in his brief statement but authorities have said he told FBI agents that he had been messaging Natalie Rupnow the Wisconsin shooter about attacking a government building with a gun and explosives. The student at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison killed Rubi Patricia Vergara a 14-year-old freshman and 42-year-old teacher Erin Michelle West and severely injured two other students before shooting herself. Police have not disclosed a motive. A day after the Dec. 16 attack a California judge issued a restraining order against Paffendorf 20 at the time under the state’s gun red flag law. It required him to turn his guns and ammunition into police. He has not been charged with any crime. Paffendorf appearing by video in a collared shirt and tie said Friday that he was ready for a hearing on whether the restraining order should stay in effect but San Diego Superior Court Judge Devon Lomayesva delayed consideration after an attorney for the city of Carlsbad north of San Diego said Pattendorf was under criminal investigation. The judge decided it was in his Pattendorf’s interest to delay the hearing because he is under investigation and did not have an attorney. A detective told the judge that the FBI expected the investigation to conclude within two to three months. The restraining order doesn’t say what government building Pattendorf targeted or when he planned to launch his attack. It also doesn’t detail his interactions with the student except to state that he was plotting a mass shooting with her.
heartbroken father of loving 16-year-old girl murdered in nashville school shooting sobs: ‘it’s not fair’,The devastated father of the 16-year-old Nashville schoolgirl gunned down by a self-loathing incel classmate Wednesday has spoken of his pain at knowing he will never see her again. “Every day I told her how much I loved her” Josselin Corea Escalante’s griev…,2025-01-23T16:56:17Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/23/us-news/heartbroken-dad-of-16-year-old-girl-killed-in-nashville-school-shooting-says-its-not-fair/,The devastated father of the 16-year-old Nashville schoolgirl gunned down by a self-loathing incel classmate Wednesday has spoken of his pain at knowing he will never see her again. “Every day I told her how much I loved her” Josselin Corea Escalante’s grieving father German Corea told WTVF in Spanish. Corea said he never thought when he sent his daughter off to school Wednesday it would be the last time he would see the soccer-loving daughter he called “daddy’s little girl.” “It’s not fair” he said sniffing away tears. Josselin was shot multiple times by ROTC cadet Solomon Henderson 17 who then shot himself dead after also wounding another girl in the cafeteria at Antioch High School. Police are investigating whether she was targeted by Henderson who praised Adolf Hitler and wrote about being an incel — someone unable to attract people — because he was a “worthless subhuman a living breathing disgrace.” Josselin’s aunt described her as a daddy’s girl and loving older sister who worked hard in school and played soccer.  “She was a very calm girl and well-behaved” Maria Corea said. “She had good grades in school. She was a girl who loved her parents and all her family.” Investigators were poring through Henderson’s troubling online footprint where he reportedly espoused racial and antisemitic content. In Henderson’s disturbing social media musings obtained by WTVT he wrote that he  “was ashamed to be Black.”  “What happens on the incel forums … is that people of color are told the only reason they’re incels is because of their color and so it pushes them toward other extreme ideology that he apparently took on” ADL representative Carla Hill told The Post Wednesday night. Henderson posted antisemitic content and posted a flyer from the Goyim Defense League — a neo-Nazi white supremacy group — and praised Adolf Hitler. Additional writings reported by The Tennessean included statements against “race-mixing” with a desire to “take revenge” on society.  He praised other mass shooters and had images of a layout of his high school guns and ammunition. Henderson partially livestreamed the shooting on the Australian platform Kick according to the company which apologized.
parkland shooting survivor and gun-control activist becomes dnc vice chair,Former student-turned-gun-control activist David Hogg 24 was among three people elected to the position Saturday during a meeting in National Harbor Md. just outside of Washington DC to elect the DNC's next suite of leaders.,2025-02-02T17:09:45Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/02/02/us-news/parkland-shooting-survivor-david-hogg-becomes-dnc-vice-chair/,A survivor of the 2018 Parkland high school shooting has become one of the new vice chairs of the Democratic National Committee. Former student-turned-gun-control activist David Hogg 24 was among three people elected to the position Saturday during a meeting in National Harbor Md. just outside of Washington DC to elect the DNC’s next suite of leaders. “I’m deeply grateful to the members for their trust and belief in me and I don’t take it lightly” Hogg wrote on X after clinching the role. Hogg has nudged Democrats to become less judgmental and more forceful in their messaging as the party dithers over what direction to take under the second Trump administration. “It’s time we stop surrendering go on offense and take the fight to Donald Trump” he added on X. “We need to show [the public] who we are again to rid our party of its judgmental attitudes and do the work to win back every group we lost this year.” Hogg notched around 215 votes and Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta scored 298 votes above the 205 threshold. Artie Blanco from Nevada nabbed the third vice chair role during the third round of voting. Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party Chair Ken Martin landed the coveted position of DNC chairman succeeding Jaime Harrison. Hogg was thrust into the national spotlight after a gunman stormed Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Fla. in February 2018 and slaughtered 17 people while injuring 17 others. The deadly mass shooting sparked national outcry over killer Nikolas Cruz’s previous violent threats and how he got access to the AR-15 he used for the slaughter while Hogg quickly emerged as one of the leading activists for gun control playing a key role in the March for Our Lives demonstration. Hogg later graduated from Harvard University and moved to DC. “After Parkland our country was in a similar moment — where we had a Republican trifecta in Washington” he said during the DNC election over the weekend. “We went on the offense put the Republicans on the defense and we won. That’s what we need to do right now.” During the DNC elections Democrats acknowledged that the party faced a drubbing in the 2024 cycle with President Trump sweeping all seven battleground states and winning the presidential popular vote as a Republican for the first time in two decades. Moreover the GOP swept back to power in the Senate and has been buoyed by a feeling that conservatives are on the cultural ascendency with prominent companies such as Meta making concessions to them. Progressive protests during Trump’s inauguration last month also paled in comparison to the behemoth demonstrations that erupted during his first inauguration back in 2017. Hogg vowed to help change this dynamic as Democrats continue soul-searching over what went awry in November. “We’re going to show people that the reason people should vote for us isn’t just because we’re not Republicans — it’s because we’re damn Democrats. We give a sh-t” he pledged. “And we deliver.  Now it’s time to rebuild the party and to rethink the way we’ve been doing things.” But Hogg’s victory to serve as a DNC vice chair was greeted with delight from his conservative detractors. “I love when they don’t learn” Donald Trump Jr. swiped on X. Conservative activist and organizer Scott Presler added “The democrats just elected rabid anti-gun activist David Hogg as Vice Chairman for the DNC.  “In 2023 Hogg posted ‘You have no right to a gun.’ To every hunter/gun owner in America it’s time to vote” Presler said. “There are so many quotes. There is so much content to work with. Democrats just gave us a huge gift by electing anti-gun David Hogg as DNC Vice Chair.” Andrew Pollack a big Trump backer who lost his daughter in the Parkland shooting wrote sarcastically “I officially endorse David Hogg to be DNC Vice Chair.  “David is the greatest gun salesman of all-time & I think he will do an even better job pushing young men further to the right.”
florida man arrested for allegedly making ‘violent’ threats against president trump,"A Florida man ​has been arrested for making ""violent"" threats against President Trump police said.",2025-01-25T17:15:01Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/25/us-news/florida-man-arrested-for-allegedly-making-violent-threats-against-trump/,A Florida man has been arrested for making “violent” threats against President Trump police said Saturday.   Shannon Depararro Atkins​ allegedly made posts on social media targeting the ​commander in chief. Atkins 46 was arrested just before 7:30 p.m. Friday during a traffic stop in West Palm Beach — where he was allegedly found with three baggies of cocaine in his pocket cops said. Authorities arrested Atkins after receiving a Jan. 19 tip pointing to disturbing posts the man had allegedly been sharing in the days before Trump’s inauguration. “America needs one good bullet to be saved” Atkins allegedly wrote on Facebook on Jan. 19 a day before Trump was inaugurated for his second term. Two hours later the same day Atkins confessed on his Facebook page that he’d been banished from Elon Musk’s X.  “I’ve been banned from “X” because I said I hope and pray someone kills him” he wrote in an apparent reference to Trump. “History is supposed to repeat itself. We haven’t had an assassination in years.” He allegedly kept going writing later in the day “Bullets please. Please Jesus! Save America” over an image of a meme calling inauguration day a “day of mourning.” “That gives you a flavor of some of the posts that this gentleman posted” West Palm Beach Police Chief Tony Araujo said at a news conference adding that the posts reflected “violent rhetoric.” Atkins had been sharing his negative feelings for Trump for months but volume dramatically increased leading up to and following the inauguration. On Friday — shortly before the arrest — he reposted a meme showing the president with his late first wife Ivanka Trump that included the phrase “I hope they get back together soon.”  Atkins allegedly included a row of smiling emojis with the post.  Atkins allegedly admitted to the violent social media posts — but claimed he was simply “joking.” “Folks this is not a joke. Nothing of that sort is a joke” Araujo said. “In today’s climate you really can’t say things like this. We have incident after incident example after example of when these threats become real. And we take these very seriously.“ Voter registration details show that Atkins voted Democrat since at least 2008. He is believed to own Big Mama’s House of Sweets a baked goods shop in West Palm Beach. Atkins was being held at the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Main Detention Center and faces a drug possession charge as well as one count of written or electronic threats to kill do bodily injury or conduct a mass shooting or an act of terrorism a second-degree felony. The secret service will determine whether they will pursue additional federal charges over Atkins’ social media threats. The arrest comes months after Trump survived two assassination attempts including a shooting during a Butler Pa. rally in July in which a bullet grazed the then-candidate’s ear.  Additional reporting by Georgia Worrell
nashville school gunman 17 who killed teen girl appeared to be ‘self-loathing incel’ adl says,"""I was so miserable. I wanted to kill myself” he also allegedly wrote at one point.",2025-01-23T05:59:10Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/23/us-news/nashville-school-gunman-solomon-henderson-who-killed-teen-girl-appeared-to-be-self-loathing-incel-adl-says/,The 17-year-old Nashville school shooter who killed a teenage girl before turning the gun on himself allegedly left a dark trail of hateful online postings and appeared to be a “self-loathing incel” according to the Anti-Defamation League. Teen shooter Solomon Henderson expressed a wide array of troubling views in a purported manifesto and on social media before gunning down 16-year-old Josselin Corea Escalante at Antioch High School on Wednesday ADL representative Carla Hill told The Post Wednesday night. “What happens on the incel forums … is that people of color are told the only reason they’re incels is because of their color and so it pushes them toward other extreme ideology that he apparently took on”  Hill said.  “He picked up antisemitism he posted a lot of anti-black content because of that … internalized racism” said Hill who is senior director of investigative research at the organization. The ADL in a fuller report issued Thursday stated it is believed Henderson self-identified as a “mentalcel” which is someone who is involuntary celibate based on an intellectual or learning disability. Metro Nashville police said Wednesday night investigators were probing “very concerning online writings and social media posts” as they attempt to determine a motive behind the attack that was partially streamed online. Escalante was fatally shot inside the cafeteria of the school and another student was grazed in the arm.  Henderson then fatally shot himself before a confrontation with police. Alleged online writings reviewed by outlets included Henderson stating that he “was ashamed to be black” WTVF reported. Other materials tied to Henderson obtained by the station included a layout of Antioch High School photos of handguns and cartridges to load the weapon.  Henderson also posted antisemitic writings and posted a flyer from the Goyim Defense League which is a neo-Nazi white supremacy group WTVF reported. “I was so miserable. I wanted to kill myself” he also allegedly wrote at one point. “I just couldn’t take anymore. I am a worthless subhuman a living breathing disgrace. All my (in real life) friends outgrew me act like they didn’t f–king know me. Being me was so f–king humiliating. That’s why I spend all day dissociating.” He also had a photo of the Covenant School shooter who killed three children and three staffers in 2023 before killing herself. Purported writings reported on by The Tennessean included statements against “race-mixing” with a desire to “take revenge” on society. Henderson also had statements praising Adolf Hitler and jarring photos from past school shootings the newspaper reported. The ADL Center on Extremism reviewed the purported manifesto and social media posts from the shooter as well as a forum he allegedly participated in that promoted white supremacy and accelerationism which is the desire to see a hastening of the collapse of modern society according to the civil rights organization. “He’s in an incel forum that’s telling him he’s an incel because he’s black no one wants you because you’re black” Hill of the ADL said of one online space. Henderson was also part of a gore forum where mass killers of all ideologies are often celebrated including the recent Madison Wisconsin shooter according to the ADL. The alleged manifesto from Henderson contained a list of “soft targets” including Jews Muslims immigrants and LGBTQ people the ADL said in its Thursday report. “The fact that the Antioch shooter appears to have been active in multiple obscure and extreme online spaces highlights a troubling trend: young people are increasingly finding interconnected online networks that are shaping violence and extremism fueling real-world tragedies” the ADL additionally said Thursday. The shooter partially livestreamed the shooting on the online platform Kick according to the company. “We extend our thoughts to everyone impacted by this event” Kick wrote on X. “Violence has no place on Kick. We are actively working with law enforcement and taking all appropriate steps to support their investigation.”
the 10 safest states in the us in 2025 — and six of them are in one region right near nyc,For crime-weary Gothamites a better life could be just up the road.,2025-01-18T02:48:47Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/17/lifestyle/the-10-safest-states-in-the-us-in-2025-see-where-new-york-ranked/,Get on I-95 North — and keep going.  For crime-weary New Yorkers a better life could be just up the road. Six out of the ten safest states in the country are in New England according to a new Wallethub survey. Vermont immediately adjacent to the Empire State landed in the number one spot. “With every new headline about a mass shooting terrorist attack hate crime or natural disaster many of us fear for our safety and that of our loved ones. Americans have to worry about their financial safety as well as the government continues to work on slowing down inflation” survey authors wrote. After examining 52 different metrics in five key categories — personal / residential safety financial safety road safety workplace safety and emergency preparedness — the data dumpers said the Green Mountain State soared higher than any other. Neighboring New Hampshire slid into second. The remainder of the New England states easily earned a spot in the top 10. Assaults per capita total loss from climate disasters per capita unemployment rates were just a few of the measurements taken added up and then further sliced and diced to come up with 100 as a perfect score.  Vermont managed a 67.94 — implying that even the safest place in the United States is far from perfect. Recent sensational crimes in the maple syrup mecca included a woman nabbed attempting to smuggle turtles across the Canadian border a suspected arson at the office of Senator Bernie Sanders and a grisly domestic shooting near the village of Pawlet. A New Yorker was later taken into custody for that crime. But the relatively peaceful state was praised for neighborhood safety and a low rate of aggravated assault as well as the seventh fewest murders and non-negligent manslaughters of any state. Vermont really excelled on the financial safety front boasting one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country — 2.1% — and one of the top rates of job growth. Other bright spots included the lowest share of seriously underwater mortgages and the second-fewest personal bankruptcies per capita. Data and identity theft were also mentioned as a low risk. The state was also rated highly for its well-maintained roads and low occurrence of traffic fatalities. The state also has the lowest percentage of drivers who have confessed to using their phones behind the wheel.  “The safest states in America protect their residents from harm in a multitude of different ways from keeping crime rates low and maintaining safe roadways to having strong economies and job markets that prevent people from falling into dangerous financial situations” Wallethub analyst Chip Lupo said.  “They have high levels of occupational safety and disaster preparedness too. In addition states are made safer by efforts that individual residents take such as forming a neighborhood watch or working in firefighting and EMT jobs at high rates” he continued. New York gave a middling performance in the nationwide survey appearing all the way down at number 24. Neighboring New Jersey came out ahead scoring 17th place. 
lgbtq liberals start arming themselves over baseless fear of being placed in ‘concentration camps:’ report,"Gay and transgender liberals around the country are arming themselves over perceived concerns they'll be rounded up and placed in ""concentration camps"" under a second Trump administration.",2025-01-06T00:35:35Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/05/us-news/lgbtq-liberals-start-arming-themselves-over-baseless-fear-of-being-placed-in-concentration-camps-report/,Gay and transgender liberals around the country are arming themselves over perceived concerns they’ll be rounded up and placed in “concentration camps” under a second Trump administration according to a report.  The Philadelphia Inquirer on Sunday profiled several members of the emerging gun-toting left who belong to groups with names like the Liberal Gun Club the Socialist Rifle Association and Pink Pistols. Although precise figures regarding LGBTQ gun ownership are tough to ascertain given the small cohort the Liberal Gun Club told the outlet that it’s received “thousands” of firearms training requests since the election — more than in all of 2023 combined — and that about a quarter of them were from those in the LGBTQ community. “Three months before the election that’s when the alarm bells started to ring” said a 24-year-old trans woman who recently decided to purchase a gun identified by the outlet only as “A.” “Minorities that are armed are more difficult to legally oppress” she said expressing relief that she’d be ready to fight back “in the event of hate crimes or terrorist attacks.” The Philadelphia chapter of the Socialist Rifle Association — a left-wing take on the National Rifle Association — told the outlet it’s seen a “surge” of paid memberships and that its gun safety classes have been filling up so fast it had to add more. The Delaware Valley chapter of gay gun group Pink Pistols which uses the slogan “Armed Gays Don’t Get Bashed” similarly told the paper they’ve been inundated with inquiries from people seeking firearms training. The group was founded in 2000 after an article was published in Salon by writer Jonathan Rauch in which he said “homosexuals should embark on organized efforts to become comfortable with guns learn to use them safely and carry them.” Wake Forest University sociology professor David Yamane — author of “Gun Curious” — told the Inquirer that a cultural shift in gun ownership is underway in America and that minority groups including gay people have “led the way” among neophyte gun owners since 2020. “It was a period of tremendous social unrest and social uncertainty. And a large number of people in the United States under those conditions look to firearms to reestablish some sense of safety and security” he said. Matthew Thompson of Oakland NJ told the outlet he was inspired to buy his first gun after the 2016 mass shooting at Pulse — a gay nightclub in Orlando Fla. — in which 49 people were killed. The Pulse attack which stands as the worst mass shooting in US history was carried out by a homegrown Islamic terrorist sympathizer named Omar Mateen.  Both then-President Barack Obama and then-presidential candidate Donald Trump denounced the horrific slaughter as a direct attack on the LGBTQ community. However evidence unearthed in the years that followed indicates Mateen had no idea Pulse was a gay nightclub when he started opening fire. Thompson who the outlet writes travels the country to attend “leather and bear events” has been working to sharpen his gun skills at home including wearing his gun around the house and quickly drawing it upon the completion of a timer on his phone. “The people I’ve been seeing on the left and the gay people who are out purchasing guns for the first time it’s all about self-defense and fear” said Thompson 36. “We’re not looking to arm up and storm the capital. We just don’t want to be put in concentration camps.” Meanwhile a recent Gallup poll shows the number of Republican women packing heat is also on the rise with 33% saying they own a gun between 2019-2024 compared to just 19% in the period between 2007-2012. At the same time the proportion of Democratic men who own guns has declined in recent years falling from 36% between 2007-2012 to just 29% between 2019-2024.
la mayor karen bass failed to deploy highly trained $1m crisis response team to help wildfire victims,"""This team is more well funded than any in the country and is sitting on its hands not responding at all"" one longtime volunteer told The Post.",2025-01-16T03:25:57Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/15/us-news/la-mayor-karen-bass-sidelined-1m-crisis-response-team-during-wildfires/,LOS ANGELES — A crisis response team reporting to LA Mayor Karen Bass – with hundreds of trained volunteers and a nearly million-dollar budget – languished on the sidelines for a week as the city endured its most devastating natural disaster ever The Post has learned. The embattled mayor’s apparent failure to quickly deploy these key support resources is the latest in a series of botched leadership decisions that has characterized her response to the Palisades Fire which has killed nine people wiped out thousands of homes and engulfed an area half the size of Brooklyn New York.  The mayor’s office did not begin putting the volunteers to work helping fire victims until Tuesday — after The Post began asking questions about why its volunteers were idle. “This team is more well funded than any in the country and is sitting on its hands not responding at all” one longtime volunteer told The Post. “I’m stunned by this.” Days after the fires broke out volunteers were notified in an email from interim director Edward Alamo obtained by The Post that their services had not been requested.  In a follow-up email the program manager Ané Vecchione reiterated to volunteers: “At this time we are not deploying to shelters or community resource centers.” Alamo and Vecchione both declined to comment. Joseph Avalos who served as director for the mayor’s Crisis Response Team (CRT) for 13 years until Bass fired him last May told The Post he was “shocked” the team had not received a callout typically a text voice message and email to its 250 members. “Then I got some phone calls from current CRT members that they’re still on standby and not involved yet. Quite honestly I don’t understand why.” Amid the fires multiple volunteers continued to receive text notifications for deployment to smaller tragedies like traffic crashes — but nothing for fire victims.  Avalos said a large callout was necessary for major incidents to quickly identify who was available to swing into action and when. LAFD spokeswoman Margaret Stewart also said she was unaware of CRT being put into action by the mayor’s office. The Los Angeles Mayor’s Crisis Response Team was created in 1992 to work with victims of fires crimes and other incidents according to the CRT website.  The group has previously responded to major tragedies like the 2023 Monterey Park mass shooting. Its trained volunteers offer “immediate on-scene practical and emotional support to survivors” according to the CRT website.  Team members are trained in everything from staffing evacuation centers to providing psychological first aid to survivors. The Palisades and Eaton fires which broke out Jan. 7 have resulted in at least 25 deaths and have damaged or destroyed more than 10000 homes and businesses. “The mayor’s crisis response team should be deployed in this incident because of the multiple fatalities that they have” said former LAFD Battalion Chief Rick Crawford. “The mayor doesn’t have to wait for a request she has all the authority to deploy them at their discretion” noted Crawford who left LAFD earlier this year and is now the emergency and crisis management coordinator for the US Capitol. The volunteer organization operates out of the mayor’s office of public safety — and reported to LA Deputy Mayor of Public Safety Brian Williams. However Williams was placed on administrative leave in late December after the FBI raided his home over a bomb threat he allegedly made against city hall.  The CRT also has no permanent director despite a job posting that went up last year. One of Williams’ staffers Christopher Anyakwo denied that the organization has been sidelined saying “the CRT is currently helping at the disaster recovery center.” However he did not address why emails were sent to volunteers saying the group was not being activated. A Bass spokesperson said the team is working “right now” in the disaster recovery center — but did not specify when the volunteers were mobilized. “We are grateful that they answered our call to serve” the statement said.
florida man accused of threatening trump is drag queen –and close pal of infamous ‘tot mom’ casey anthony,"Shannon Depararro Atkins -- a k a ""Big Momma'' -- regularly hangs out with the former murder defendant and the two even posted pictures together on their now-scrubbed social media The Post can reveal.",2025-01-27T22:08:40Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/27/us-news/florida-man-accused-of-threatening-trump-is-drag-queen-and-close-pal-of-infamous-tot-mom-casey-anthony/,A Florida man accused of making “violent” threats against President Trump is a well-known comedy drag queen who counts notorious “tot mom” Casey Anthony among his close friends. Shannon Depararro Atkins — a k a “Big Momma” — regularly hangs out with the former murder defendant and the two even posted pictures together on their now-scrubbed social media The Post can reveal. “Yes they are friends” a pal of Anthony’s confirmed. “She always said that he was really funny and she liked to hang around him because he made her laugh so much.  “She doesn’t like Trump either but I don’t think their friendship is based on that. I think they just have similar senses of humor” the source said. Atkins a 46-year-old bakery owner was arrested Friday on suspicion of making threats against Trump on social media. He was busted during a traffic stop in West Palm Beach — where he also was found with three baggies of cocaine in his pocket cops said. He faces a second-degree felony charge of written or electronic threats to kill do bodily injury or conduct a mass shooting or an act of terrorism as well as a felony rap for cocaine possession. Atkins is known in the South Florida area as the owner of “Big Mama’s House of Sweets” a bakery that specializes in cheesecakes. As part of his business he has adopted the drag persona “Big Momma” and has appeared at brunches and other events in the Palm Beach area. Authorities arrested Atkins after receiving a Jan. 19 tip pointing to disturbing posts he allegedly had been sharing in the days before Trump’s inauguration. “America needs one good bullet to be saved” Atkins allegedly wrote on Facebook on Jan. 19 a day before Trump was inaugurated for his second term. Two hours later Atkins complained about being banned from X. “I’ve been banned from ‘X’ because I said I hope and pray someone kills him” he wrote in an apparent reference to Trump. “History is supposed to repeat itself. We haven’t had an assassination in years.” Atkins then allegedly kept going writing later in the day “Bullets please. Please Jesus! Save America” over an image of a meme calling inauguration day a “day of mourning.” West Palm Beach Police Chief Tony Araujo said at a news conference that the posts reflected “violent rhetoric.” “That gives you a flavor of some of the posts that this gentleman posted” the cop said. Atkins allegedly admitted to the violent social media posts — but claimed he was simply “joking.” Atkins’ pal Anthony is no stranger to the law herself.  She first entered the public consciousness after the disappearance of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee in 2008. The little girl had been missing for more than a month before Casey’s mother Cindy called 911 to report the disappearance. When the little girl’s remains were found six months later Anthony was charged first-degree murder.  She was later acquitted in a 2011 murder trial that became a media circus with an estimated 40 million Americans watching at least part of the court proceeding — and the verdict seen by nearly 100 million people worldwide. Anthony’s pal who spoke to The Post said she will stick by Atkins after his arrest. “She is very loyal” the friend said. “It’ll take more than an arrest for her to turn her back on him. She’s going to remain close to him.” 
a targeted cybertruck explosion: letters to the editor — jan. 6 2025,NY Post readers discuss suspect Matthew Livelsberger exploding a Tesla Cybertruck outside of Trump Hotel Las Vegas.,2025-01-05T21:22:15Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/05/opinion/a-targeted-cybertruck-explosion-letters/,The attack in one of America’s most iconic cities is a direct result if President Biden’s term (“New Year’s evil” Jan. 2). The whole world — including the terrorists — knows that America is led by the worst president in our nation’s history and they’re taking advantage of Biden’s deadly reign before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. It is unbelievable to think that so many people wanted to extend this unmitigated disaster for another four years. Louie Rey Summerville SC Some would say the term “honest politician” is a classic example of an oxymoron. Still an even more moronic oxymoron is one offered by the uncle of the man who was driving the Tesla Cybertruck that blew up outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. “He loved Trump and he was always a very very patriotic soldier a patriotic American” his uncle said. I beg your pardon but it seems to me that someone professing love for another would not blow up a truck outside of their property to show their affection. Perhaps the bomber was upset about pledges that Trump appears to be breaking before he even gets back to the White House. That would include ending the war in Ukraine and lowering grocery prices which he said he would do during his campaign but now says may not be so easy after all. Vin Morabito Scranton Pa. Early on New Year’s Day one truck killed 15 people in New Orleans the Cybertruck explosion killed another in Las Vegas and a mass shooting in Queens wounded 10 more. I am sure liberals will scream loudest at the shooting and ignore the fact that violence is the real problem — not guns. People have been killing each other since the dawn of history before guns were invented. They are only one means of killing but not the real problem — violence is. Max Wisotsky Highland Park NJ It seems that electric vehicles could be a new weapon of choice for terrorists. How de rigueur! You can carry enough fossil fuel in them to ignite explosions without emitting pollutants getting there — how green! Can you imagine what Tim McVeigh might have done with one of these? James Evans Worcester Mass. A CBS reporter saying the media should have been more forceful in questioning the cognitive decline of President Biden and how it could have changed the election is just laughable (“CBS vet: Biden’s decline a news fail” Dec. 31). The network was complicit in hiding it for four years. Now we’re to believe it’s turned some stone over and is going to do real reporting? Legacy media is dead. There is nothing they can say or do now to change that narrative. In fact both parties have lied to us for decades. Yes the country seems to be in safe hands after President-elect Trump won the election. But until people go to prison I’m not going to be impressed by him. James Schwartz Summit NJ Her use of gaslighting downplays the conspiratorial nature of these deceptions by the media and any exploitation of them in the future. Noticeably absent from any remarks made by Jan Crawford was the mention of honesty integrity and ethics. Instead what she offered was her lament of a failed opportunity for one political party to change the outcome of the election — presumably in their favor. Vincent Ruggiero Scottsdale Ariz.

elkhart indiana grocery store shooting leaves two people dead and two officers injured,Two people were killed and two police officers were injured in a shooting Monday evening at a supermarket in northern Indiana police said.,2025-01-28T09:39:19Z,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/us/elkhart-indiana-grocery-store-shooting/index.html,Two people were killed and two police officers were injured in a shooting Monday evening at a supermarket in northern Indiana police said. The shooter died in a confrontation with police officials said. The incident began around 5:30 p.m. when a gunman opened fire at Martin’s Super Market the Elkhart Police Department said in a statement. A call reporting the attack was made to the city’s 911 center and officers and first responders arrived shortly after. Inside the store they found two people fatally shot pronouncing them dead at the scene the statement said. Officers then “engaged the shooting suspect” outside the store. “During that engagement two Elkhart Police Department officers sustained gunshot wounds and the alleged shooting suspect was shot and killed” the statement said. Both officers were taken to local hospitals. One was treated and released while the other remained hospitalized in fair but stable condition Monday night officials said. “There is believed to be no further danger to the public” police said. The shooting marks the latest example of everyday tasks being disrupted by gunfire in the US. At least 20 mass shootings have occurred in the US so far this year according to the Gun Violence Archive which like CNN defines such events as those involving four or more people shot not including the gunman. Last year the country tallied more than 500 mass shootings. Elkhart Mayor Rod Roberson called on the community to pray for everyone affected including “our two police officers who were wounded our heroic first responders and those at the incident.” Authorities have not released the identities of the victims the suspect or the officers involved as they work to notify family members. The motive for the shooting is unclear. The Elkhart County Homicide Unit is leading the investigation with assistance from the Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office and the Indiana State Police. CNN reached out to the Elkhart Police Department and the Elkhart County Homicide Unit for comment. Erin Swary a pregnant mother was chatting with the employee bagging her groceries when she heard a pop she told CNN affiliate WNDU. “I thought it was a balloon” Swary said. “We all looked around and I saw everyone starting to duck.” She described hearing “six to eight shots just one right after another” forcing her to drop to the ground. “All I could think while I was down there was of my kids” she told WNDU. “If he came around that corner I thought I would probably [be] gone or shot as well.” Swary said she eventually made it out of the store where she stopped and warned a man against entering according to the outlet. Indiana Governor Mike Braun said he has been in contact with law enforcement officials and extended his condolences in a statement on X. “Maureen and I are praying for the victims and their families” he wrote. “In this horrific situation words cannot express the pain felt in our community when a tragic incident like this happens” said Chief Dan Milanese of the Elkhart Police Department. Elkhart a city in Elkhart County 15 miles east of South Bend had a population of 53484 in 2023.
teacher who forced nj school district to close allegedly posted disturbing threats about principal,“MONTCLAIR SCHOOL SHOOTING KILLS DR. JOE. JOE IS DEAD. HE DIES TONIGHT” the teacher allegedly wrote in the description box of a now-removed YouTube video.,2025-01-15T23:06:49Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/15/us-news/montclair-nj-teacher-threatened-to-shoot-kill-principal-reports/,The New Jersey teacher whose alleged threats forced the closure of a ritzy suburban school district earlier this week posted disturbing messages — including that the school’s principal should “DIE TONIGHT” and “There’s gonna be a war.” Amir Doctry a 45-year-old special education teacher was picked up in Philadelphia on Monday morning after writing menacing texts and social media posts about Montclair elementary school Principal Joseph Putrino NJ.com reported. “MONTCLAIR SCHOOL SHOOTING KILLS DR. JOE. JOE IS DEAD. HE DIES TONIGHT” Doctry allegedly wrote in the description box of a now-removed YouTube video. State and federal authorities tracked Doctry — who was already on administrative leave — to Pennsylvania after the unhinged posts and local cops arrested him at about 8 a.m. Police charged him with two counts of third-degree terroristic threats then put him in an involuntary psychiatric hold at a crisis center the outlet said. The Montclair school district closed Monday as a precaution but reopened the next day. “We would like to reassure the public that there is no further danger to our community” local cops said adding they boosted patrols at district schools “out of an abundance of caution.” Putrino had noticed other troubling behavior with Doctry as well — like last week when local cops came to the school after the principal reported Doctry signed into his classroom despite being barred from it because of his leave NJ.com said. The irate teacher allegedly began sending Putrino profanity-laced text messages that included a bizarre claim that he’d become the principal’s boss and fire him. He also sent Putrino texts with random emojis — including Jewish stars and menorahs — and called him a “dummy” the outlet reported. “Please like and subscribe! Love you Joe! Thanks for the job” one text said.  The principal told the cops about Doctry’s weird behavior on Sunday — then discovered the YouTube channel where Doctry allegedly posted a photo of Denzel Washington holding a gun with the caption “ALL PARENTS IN MONTCLAIR.” He also found references to a school shooting and remarks like “Joe must die” the newspaper said. YouTube removed the video for violating its community guidelines. But Doctry continued his strange behavior Monday texting Putrino nonsense gibberish that included phrases like “Die bitch” and “There’s gonna be a war” cops said. That was enough to alarm police — and shutter the schools in the town of about 40000 a half-hour west of Manhattan. “I understand that this last-minute closure may cause inconvenience but the safety of our students staff and entire school community is our highest priority” district superintendent Damen Cooper wrote in an email. “Please know that every step taken was guided by our unwavering commitment to the safety and well-being of our students staff and families.” A childhood pal of the suspect told TAPinto Montclair that the incident was very unlike him. “It is all so shocking” the friend said.
nashville school shooter appears to have been in contact with natalie rupnow: report,The suspected gunman behind a deadly Nashville school shooting may have been in contact with another teen who opened fire at a Madison Wisconsin school just last month law enforcement sources told ABC News. Officials are investigating possible ties between …,2025-01-24T14:50:42Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/us-news/nashville-school-shooter-may-have-been-in-contact-with-fellow-shooter-natalie-rupnow/,The hate-filled teenage incel who gunned down a fellow pupil at his Nashville school this week appears to have been in contact with fellow Christian school shooter Natalie “Samantha” Rupnow according to a report. The online accounts of Solomon Henderson the 17-year-old who shot himself dead after murdering a 16-year-old girl Wednesday showed ties with Rupnow the 15-year-old who also killed herself after fatally shooting two at her school in Madison Wisconsin law enforcement sources told ABC News. Rupnow even appears to have been following Henderson online before she died — a month before he also shot up his Christian school more than 600 miles from her the sources said. A Bluesky account linked to Henderson also posted an edited image of Rupnow a day before the shooting the outlet said without making clear which of the attacks it meant. Another post on the same Bluesky account mentioned intentions of carrying out a shooting with a second person that day the report said again without making clear if it meant Rupnow’s attack in December or Henderson’s bloodbath this week. Both teens died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds after carrying out separate massacres — and showed disturbing interest in neo-Nazi ideology and violence in their online search histories reports said. Both teens also revered other school shooters with both posting about the massacre at Parkland Florida.  Henderson also made Pinterest posts about the horror at Uvalde Texas while Rupnow posted about the Columbine school shooting according to the outlet. Henderson’s also posted a 51-page document expressing violent hatred towards Jewish people and self-hatred as a black person which he blamed for him being an incel a person unattractive to others. Henderson carried out the shooting just after 11 a.m. Wednesday at Antioch High School – about 45 minutes southeast of downtown Nashville – where he “confronted” 16-year-old Josselin Corea Escalante and shot her multiple times killing her.  One other student was hit in the arm and was taken to the hospital while another suffered a face injury that wasn’t from the gun. Henderson then turned the gun on himself. Police say Henderson rode the bus to Antioch High School Wednesday morning then slipped into the bathroom and came out with a handgun. He then went into the cafeteria where he opened fire and killed Escalante after accosting her. Footage from inside the cafeteria captured the final gunshots as students and cafeteria workers cowered for cover.
smartphone use leads to hallucinations detachment from reality aggression in teens as young as 13: study,"""People don't fully appreciate that hyper-real and hyper-immersive screen experiences can blur reality at key stages of development"" addiction psychologist Dr. Nicholas Kardaras told The Post.",2025-01-23T11:00:00Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/23/lifestyle/smartphone-use-leads-to-hallucinations-aggression-in-teens-study/,Smartphones are making teenagers more aggressive detached from reality and causing them to hallucinate according to new research. Scientists concluded the younger a person starts using a phone the more likely they would be crippled by a whole host of psychological ills after surveying 10500 teens between 13 and 17 from both the US and India for the study by Sapien Labs. “People don’t fully appreciate that hyper-real and hyper-immersive screen experiences can blur reality at key stages of development” addiction psychologist Dr. Nicholas Kardaras who was not part of the team who did the study told The Post. “Their digital world can compromise their ability to distinguish between what’s real and what’s not. A hallucination by any other name. “Screen time essentially acts as a toxin that stunts both brain development and social development” Kardaras explained. “The younger a kid is when given a device the higher the likelihood of mental health issues later on.” The teens surveyed for “The Youth Mind: Rising Aggression and Anger” were significantly worse off than older Gen Zers in Sapien Labs’ database and the youngest ages were more likely to suffer aggression anger and hallucinations compared to their older counterparts. A staggering 37% of 13-year-olds reported experiencing aggression compared with 27% of 17-year-olds. Frighteningly 20% of 13-year-olds say they suffer from hallucinations compared to 12% of 17-year-olds. “Whereas today’s 17-year-olds typically got a phone at age 11 or 12 today’s 13-year-olds got their phones at age 10” the report noted. Respondents also reported they could pose a harm to themselves. 42% of American girls and 27% of boys aged 13 to 17 admitted to problems with suicidal thoughts. The majority of teens polled said they had feelings of hopelessness guilt anxiety and unwanted strange thoughts. More than 40% reported a sense of detachment from reality mood swings withdrawal and traumatic flashbacks. The researchers also warned phones are making kids withdraw from society. “Once you have a phone you spend a lot less time with in-person interaction and the less you have in-person interaction the less integrated you are into the real social fabric” Sapien Labs chief scientist Tara Thiagarajan told The Post. “You’re no longer connected in the way humans have been wired for hundreds of thousands of years.” Kardaras author of “Glow Kids” also wasn’t surprised aggression was associated with phone use. He runs Omega Recovery tech addiction recovery center in Austin where teens are often admitted after violently attacking their parents for taking their phones away. Kids around the country have also been assaulting their teachers at school after having their devices confiscated with one Tennessee teacher even pepper-sprayed by a female student after he took her cell phone. The CDC also warned in 2023 teen girls are at risk of increased violence — often at the hands of one another. Sapien Labs also flagged the uptick in aggression is disproportionately taking place in females according to their research. “There’s a fairly rapid rise now in kids experiencing actual violence in school and kids are fearing for their safety” Thiagarajan said. “That is something that everyone should sit up and take note of.” She pointed to a December school shooting in Wisconsin was anomalously carried out by a teen girl. It had been 45 years since a female juvenile perpetrated a school shooting. That shooter Natalie “Samantha” Rupnow 15 was known to have spent a great deal of her life online and had exhibited extremist views on the internet but authorities are still looking for a motive for her shooting after which she turned her gun on herself. Overall 65% of female respondents were deemed “distressed or struggling in a manner that substantially impairs their ability to function effectively in the world and would be of clinical concern” according to the report. There’s no indication that this trend of continually worsening mental health will slow according to the researchers who point out kids continue to be given devices at younger and younger ages and it’s not uncommon today for toddlers to be given access to iPads or their parents’ iPhones.
tennessee house overhauls rules — and some lawmakers could be put in ‘time out’,The Tennessee House is warning lawmakers and the crowds watching legislative floor sessions that they could be booted from the room.,2025-01-16T21:47:03Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/16/us-news/new-tennessee-house-rules-to-ban-hecklers/, The Tennessee House is warning lawmakers and the crowds watching legislative floor sessions that they could be booted from the room if their behavior is deemed out of line. For lawmakers after multiple infractions they could be removed from the floor a few days at a time and forced to vote remotely. For the public they could be banned up to two years for particularly bad or frequently disruptive behavior. The tougher punishment options came in a news rules package passed Thursday. “You’re on the House floor and you’re expected to have decorum and respect for the institution” Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton told reporters. “Same thing in the gallery.” The stiffer rules mark another instance in the U.S. where state lawmakers are focusing on punishments when they find their peers are misbehaving. The topic returned to the forefront Thursday in Georgia when state Sen. Colton Moore who had been previously banned from the House chamber was arrested after a shoving match with House employees where the right-wing Republican fell to the floor trying to enter the chamber for the governor’s state of the state. Rowdy crowds have drawn attention in legislatures elsewhere too. In Rhode Island the public was blocked from entering the rotunda on Wednesday for hours for Democratic Gov. Dan McKee’s state of the state speech including protesters calling for action on homelessness according to news reports. Tennessee House Republicans have been tinkering with the rules to dissuade disruption from political opponents since 2023. That’s when they expelled two Democratic lawmakers for a protest on the floor calling for gun control after a deadly school shooting. The move backfired politically putting Tennessee in the national spotlight and elevating the Democratic representatives’ profile with huge fundraising hauls. Yet Republicans kept the same supermajority after November. Rep. Gloria Johnson the Democrat who survived the expulsion votes called the Tennessee House changes “the most ridiculous fascist rules.” “They are sending members to ‘time out’ for being ‘out of order’” Johnson posted on social media Thursday. “Remember that to them if you mention the word racism they will call you out of order.” The changes come as Speaker Sexton has become a top target of criticism from left-leaning Capitol visitors. In pushing the changes House Republicans noted that Congress has strict decorum rules for gallery visitors. While both Tennessee chambers are controlled by Republicans the House has long attracted the most bombastic conflicts — both among lawmakers but also from the gallery. The Senate has not changed its rules or aimed to quiet lawmakers or visitors. On a few occasions audience outcry has stalled House action after a contentious bill passed and state troopers were ordered to clear the stands. It’s not uncommon for some to unfurl signs or shout profanities during particularly fiery debates. In response Republicans have sought to silence protesters they deem too unruly. In 2023 they banned visitors from carrying signs inside the Capitol and in hearing rooms during a brief special session. The rule was later challenged in court and paused by a judge but lawmakers adjourned before the case was settled. They haven’t reinstituted the ban. Last year House GOP officials made half the public gallery require tickets. Each of the 99 House members would get one ticket to give to someone each day of the House session. The ticketed side holds 128 seats. The other has 120 seats and remains first-come first-serve. The new remote-voting penalty for lawmakers is largely tailored to one of the expelled-and-returned lawmakers. On numerous occasions Republicans have ruled Rep. Justin Jones’ comments out-of-order and voted to temporarily silence him previously at times saying he’s talking out of turn speaking ill of another lawmaker or veering off-topic. Jones has said the House speaker at times has ignored his requests to speak. Jones has also claimed a double standard in which Republicans aren’t punished for comparable behavior. Sexton likened the rule to one in Montana where Republicans voted in 2023 to temporarily silence and banish Rep. Zooey Zephyr to remote voting. The transgender Democrat said colleagues supporting a ban on gender-affirming care for youths would have “blood” on their hands. Also under the new rules package gallery visitors who try to get the attention of someone on the floor or whose actions are deemed by the House speaker to be detrimental to proceedings will be removed and banned from returning that day or the next legislative day. If someone shows “especially egregious conduct” or is repeatedly kicked out they could be banned longer up to a full two-year legislative term. Lawmakers meanwhile could be removed from the House floor and forced to vote remotely after being ruled out of order enough times on multiple days.
infowars sale could be near as feuding sandy hook families reach deal on dividing bankrupt alex jones’ assets,The disagreement helped scuttle a previous auction of Jones’ Infowars company after the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee decided to sell Infowars to the Onion for $1.75 million with the Connecticut families’ backing.,2025-01-14T00:27:52Z,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/01/13/media/infowars-sale-could-be-near-as-feuding-sandy-hook-families-reach-deal-on-dividing-bankrupt-alex-jones-assets/,Families who have sued Alex Jones over his false claims about the Sandy Hook massacre have resolved their disputes on how to divide the bankrupt conspiracy theorist’s assets clearing the way for a sale of Jones’ Infowars platform attorneys said at a Monday court hearing. Joshua Wolfshohl an attorney for the bankruptcy trustee in charge of selling Jones’ assets told US Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston that the agreement would help get the bankruptcy “back on track” and clear the way for a new auction of Infowars. Courts in Connecticut and Texas where some of the families filed their lawsuits have ruled Jones defamed the families by making repeated false claims that the 2012 school shooting which killed 20 students and six staff members in Newton Conn. was staged as part of a government plot to take guns away from Americans. But the families had disagreed over how to pursue Jones’ assets after he declared bankruptcy in 2022 with the Texas-based families preferring to take more cash from Jones while the Connecticut-based families prioritized the shutdown of Jones’ Infowars company. The disagreement helped scuttle a previous auction of Jones’ Infowars company after the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee decided to sell Infowars to the parody news site the Onion for $1.75 million with the Connecticut families’ backing. Lopez who is overseeing the bankruptcy later blocked that sale saying that the trustee left “money on the table” by quickly accepting the Onion’s bid without conducting a more robust auction. Under the new agreement between the Sandy Hook families the Texas families will be paid $4 million with $1 million being paid within seven days of court approval according to court documents. After that the Texas families will receive 25% of future payments made to the Sandy Hook families with the Connecticut families taking 75%. The Texas families also agreed to limit their participation in the rest of Jones’ bankruptcy case and to support the Connecticut families when necessary. Avi Moshenberg an attorney for the Texas families said at a Monday court hearing in Houston Texas that the Texas and Connecticut families are now “100% aligned.” “The settlement with the Texas families is a milestone event and puts the families back on the same side” said Kyle Kimpler an attorney for the Connecticut families. The families’ previous split reflected the relative size of the judgments awarded to them which gave the Connecticut families much more leverage over Jones’ bankruptcy. Courts in Connecticut awarded $1.3 billion to the Connecticut families by far the largest claim in Jones’ bankruptcy. Courts in Texas meanwhile awarded $50 million to two Texas parents while several other Texas plaintiffs were still waiting for trials when Jones’ bankruptcy stopped their lawsuits from proceeding. A lawyer for Jones said he would discuss the families’ agreement with Jones. Lopez has set a hearing for next week to consider approving the deal. After the previous sale to the Onion was blocked in court the bankruptcy trustee received a new bid from First United American Companies – a company affiliated with one of Jones’ supplement selling businesses – for more than double the company’s previous $3.75 million offer. The trustee expects to receive a new bid from the Onion as well and he will evaluate both offers before seeking court approval for a new auction Wolfshohl said.
antioch high school shooting: nashville police say 1 student killed 1 wounded,A female student has died and another was wounded in a shooting Wednesday morning at Antioch High School in Nashville a police spokesman said. The male shooter killed himself.,2025-01-22T18:02:10Z,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/22/us/antioch-high-school-shooting-nashville/index.html,Law enforcement officials seeking a motive for a shooting at Nashville’s Antioch High School on Wednesday morning are examining alarming social media posts and writings tied to a teenager police say shot and killed a 16-year-old girl. The shooter identified by Metro Nashville Police as 17-year-old Solomon Henderson fired 10 shots within 17 seconds inside a cafeteria shortly after 11 a.m. –– killing Josselin Corea Escalante. Josselin’s family described her as kind and loving CNN affiliate WTVF reported. Henderson killed himself after the attack police said. One student a 17-year-old boy suffered a graze wound to the arm and was treated and released police said while another male student sustained a facial injury but was not shot. Police did not name those victims. Wednesday’s tragedy which sent students in the cafeteria scrambling for cover was the first school shooting in the US this year based on CNN’s school shooting database parameters. There were 83 school shootings in 2024 the most of any year CNN has tracked. AI gun detection software which is used in all Metro Nashville Public Schools failed to detect the shooter’s gun district officials said Thursday. The technology called Omnilert didn’t spot the weapon because the shooter wasn’t close enough to cameras to get an accurate read and activate the alarm the school district said. “It does work but it’s not going to work in every instance in every spot based on where that weapon might be visible” Sean Braisted chief of communications and technology for the district said in a news conference Thursday. Omnilert CEO Dave Fraser said the safety and well-being of its schools is the company’s top priority. “Our hearts go out to the students staff families and the entire Nashville community affected by this tragic event” Fraser said in a statement to CNN Thursday. “We can confirm that the Omnilert Gun Detect system is deployed at MNPS schools but in this case the location of the shooter and the firearm meant that the weapon was not visible” Fraser said. “This is not a case of the firearm not being recognized by the system.” School district director Adrienne Battle said the district will enhance security measures in response to the tragedy. “As we’ve seen a heightened sense around the safety and security in our schools both with external (and) internal threats we are continuing to research and study the most evolving technologies that will help us enhance the safety and security measures within our schools” Battle said at the news conference. The suspect livestreamed himself inside the school minutes before the shooting began a video posted to the Australian streaming platform Kick shows. In the video the suspect who’s wearing black boots attempts to open a door before walking away from it and walking past a vending machine. Kick released a statement noting the account and video were “rapidly banned.” “Violence has no place on Kick. We are actively working with law enforcement and taking all appropriate steps to support their investigation” the statement said. In addition to the livestream a photo posted to the suspect’s Kick account read “you already failed to stop what’s happening.” Authorities are investigating whether the victims were directly targeted by Henderson or struck by random gunfire Metro Nashville Police said. The department has also been examining “very concerning online writings and social media posts” which it says could reveal clues to Henderson’s motive. Two documents believed to have been created by Henderson were found online authorities said Thursday. The 51-page and 288-page documents are under investigation along with evidence recovered from his home Wednesday according to police. “It is clear that Henderson was significantly influenced by web-based material especially that found on non-traditional sites that most would find harmful and objectionable” Metro Nashville Police said Thursday. “The FBI is working closely with the MNPD in the ideological influences portion of this investigation.” Social media posts and videos posted by the suspect show a history of racist antisemitic and violent beliefs. The online writings include a long rambling look into the suspects views on race religion and society. He espouses violence as the solution to what he viewed as society’s problems. They also include a detailed plan of the shooting and a layout of the school. Photos of tools the shooter claimed he would use to carry out his plans and photos of handguns with ammunition are also included in the writings. The posts also mention Henderson was inspired by recent school shooters such as Natalie “Samantha” Rupnow and Colt Gray who authorities say attacked their schools in 2024. His writings mention connections with some of them on online messaging platforms. These connections have not been confirmed according to MNPD who CNN has reached out to. Rupnow 15 died by suicide after police say she killed a staff member and a student while wounding six others at her Wisconsin private Christian school. Gray has pleaded not guilty in the shooting deaths of four people at a Georgia High School. Law enforcement officials are also working to determine where the handgun Henderson used came from and how he obtained it. The pistol was purchased in Arizona in 2022 and had not been reported stolen Nashville police said Thursday. Henderson’s mother had driven him to school on Wednesday police said. Before entering the cafeteria that morning he went into a nearby restroom where he posted photos to social media according to law enforcement. Antioch senior Brandi Lemons was about to get in line to buy lunch in the cafeteria when she suddenly heard a loud “pop” she said. Students in the lunch line turned around to see what the noise was. Then three more loud pops rang out. “Everybody started running and I ran to the left side of the cafeteria” Brandi told CNN. Everyone tried to climb over a milk counter to reach the back door of the cafeteria and escape she said. Some students struggled to climb over the counter so Brandi tried to assist them. “Honestly I decided to help people before I helped myself because I know if that was me struggling to get out I would want somebody to help me” she said. Suddenly the shooter came around the corner where Brandi and others were hiding she said. She didn’t know the shooter she said. “When I realized that he saw the rest of us still in the corner I thought that was it” Brandi said through tears. “I thought he was going to get us too.” But instead the shooter killed himself. Quickly after Brandi climbed over the milk counter with the other students and ran outside. “I’m just shaken up” she told CNN. Another student Candace Huff described witnessing the horror to CNN. “I was freaking out hyperventilating everything. And I felt stressed overwhelmed. I felt like my whole world was crumbling apart in my hands and I didn’t have my phone so I couldn’t call my mom” Huff said. “And so I was really just there … and no one would know that I’m gone.” Josselin Corea Escalante’s father is beyond devastated by the loss he told WTVF. He said his daughter always got good grades and enjoyed playing soccer. Even though she was an older sister Josselin was still daddy’s little girl German Corea told WTVF. “Every day I told her how much I loved her” Corea told the affiliate in Spanish. When he sent her to school Wednesday he never imagined she wouldn’t come home Corea said. “It’s not fair” he said. Josselin’s aunt Maria Corea said the family is at a loss for words. “Oh God. She was my girl” she told WTVF. “She was a very calm girl and well-behaved. She had good grades in school. She was a girl who loved her parents and all her family.” It was “a heartbreaking day” for the school community the director of the Metro Nashville Public Schools district said. “My heart goes out to the families of our students as they face unimaginable loss. I want to thank the school staff who quickly and heroically followed emergency protocols potentially preventing further harm as well as the Metro Nashville Police Department and Nashville Fire Department for their swift and urgent response” Battle said in a statement. A new fund has been established by the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee to aid victims and their families officials announced Thursday. The district said it was making counselors available to students. The school will be closed for the rest of the week the district said. Antioch High School has around 2000 students in grades 9 through 12 according to its website. The school is in Nashville’s Antioch neighborhood about 10 miles southeast of downtown. Two student resource officers known as SROs were in the school at the time of the shooting but the incident was over by the time they got to the scene police spokesperson Don Aaron said. “We grieve together tonight as a city. We responded together earlier today. We have to respond tomorrow amidst the chaos. We feel frustration and anguish. We will heal together. Our communities deserve better. I have two daughters and they should be safe and feel safe” Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell said at a vigil held at Antioch Church on Wednesday evening. Democratic Tennessee State Rep. Justin Jones whose district includes parts of Nashville and was a vocal proponent of new gun control laws following the shooting deaths of three students and three adults at The Covenant School in Nashville in March 2023 said Wednesday no child should be scared “because of the omnipresent threat of gun violence.” “The fear reverberating around the Antioch and Nashville communities today is a chilling reminder of the human cost of political inaction and the senseless tragedy of gun violence perpetuated by leaders who have prioritized firearms and the profits of the gun industry over the lives of our students” Jones said. Jones was one of two Black lawmakers expelled then swiftly reinstated after calling for gun control reform on the House floor in 2023. This story has been updated with additional information.

Kennedy Jr. set out in late 2021 to hawk a conspiracy theory-drenched book attacking Anthony Fauci for his work to limit the spread of infectious diseases he ran into a problem. Mainstream TV networks weren’t interested due to Kennedy’s penchant for spreading falsehoods about childhood vaccinations Covid and other topics. “Nobody would put him on at that time” a person who has worked with Kennedy said. “He wasn’t newsworthy and this was not a subject anyone would talk about.” Thwarted Kennedy went where his conspiracy theorizing was welcome. The longtime Democrat appeared on far-right Newsmax and One America News Network. He was also welcomed on the even more extreme Infowars which was run by veteran conspiracy theorist Alex Jones who has peddled outrageous lies including the notion that the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting that left 20 elementary school students and six educators dead was a hoax. In a December 2 2021 interview—conducted by Infowars host Kristi Leigh—Kennedy in a rambling statement seemed to liken mask mandates to policies imposed by “Hitler when he went into Romania and Czechoslovakia and Poland.” Kennedy also claimed he was working with unnamed prosecutors to ensure Fauci and others could be “brought to justice” for unspecified crimes. He complained that the New York Times bestseller list was falsely crediting actor Will Smith’s memoir with outselling his book. “That’s another indicia of censorship” Kennedy said. Kennedy did not appear again on the program but this interview was part of an ongoing relationship between Jones and Kennedy. Jones has been heaping praise on Kennedy ever since and Infowars has extensively promoted Kennedy’s book. Del Bigtree a prominent anti-vax activist who served as a spokesman for Kennedy’s 2024 presidential campaign and who continues to advise him has also appeared on Infowars including a late-October appearance in which Jones interviewed him. Kennedy’s far-right book tour preceded the famous scion’s well-known journey from Democrat to independent to McDonald’s-clutching MAGA loyalist. Along the way Kennedy cozied up to prominent Trumpists including Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson. In July 2021 Kennedy spoke at an event held by the Christian nationalist Reawaken America and afterwards posed with MAGA stalwarts Michael Flynn and Roger Stone. Mother Jones obtained a picture of the meeting. These ties may feel like old news especially after a long parade of weird and troubling revelations about Kennedy—his brainworm his fondness for messing with animal corpses his supposed sexting stamina his suggestion that vaccine foes have it worse than Anne Frank even an allegation of sexual assault. And Kennedy’s endorsement of Donald Trump who he once had blasted as a “terrible president” certainly overshadowed his previous dabbling with MAGA extremists. But Trump’s nomination of Kennedy as Health and Human Services Secretary means his associations face new scrutiny. Two separate Senate panels—the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee and the Finance Committee—are planing to hold hearings on his potential appointment. Only the Finance Committee will vote on the nomination; if successful in that committee Kennedy would then face a vote in the full Senate. Kennedy’s willingness to affiliate with fringe figures in particular Jones is among among the issues Democrats plan to scrutinize according to Senate aides. GOP senators on the other hand are more likely to take issue with Kennedy’s past support for abortion rights. Though Jones was unable to personally interview Kennedy in 2021 due to a scheduling problem the person who worked with Kennedy said the conspiracy theorist was thrilled by the booking. “At the time it was a pretty big get to Alex” the source said. “Alex was fascinated by Kennedy.” After Kennedy launched his presidential campaign Jones and Inforwars regularly praised him for advancing views that Jones shared. “RFK Jr. Announces Run for President – Here’s Why This Is AWESOME” an April 2023 Infowars headline blared. “Robert F Kennedy Andrew Tate: ‘Alex Jones Was Right’ They’re Turning the Freakin’ Kids Gay” Infowars reported in June 2023. That article celebrated Kennedy’s unfounded claims that chemicals commonly found in drinking water affect children’s gender and sexual orientation calling them consistent with arguments Jones had made. The same month Jones bragged that Kennedy’s rhetoric was starting to resemble his own. “RFK is becoming Alex Jones” the host said. The Infowars store which vigorously hawks vitamin supplements and Jones’ merch has been selling Kennedy’s Fauci book for $29.99. Bigtree the Kennedy ally and staffer who has reportedly been a transition adviser has made three appearances on Infowars since December 2020. An anti-vaccine activist who once donned a yellow star at a vaccine protest Bigtree used these Infowars appearances to plug a nonprofit he runs the Informed Consent Action Network—which opposes various vaccines—and to spew a torrent of bizarre and bogus claims. In a December 2020 appearance on Infowars Bigtree predicted that vaccine recipients would soon “drop dead in the street.” He called the Covid vaccine “one of the most dangerous experiments in world history” and exclaimed “The world is about to eradicate itself.” Once “stupid people” wipe themselves out” with the vaccine he predicted “the earth is going to be ours.” Bigtree contended that vaccinated women would not be able to become pregnant and he urged men who did get vaccinated to first “freeze your sperm” because the shots “could mutate the genes” in semen. In the same interview Bigtree said that anti-Covid measures were part of an attempted “communist takeover of the world.” He added “If you ever wondered how you would behave in Nazi Germany now you know.” Bigtree was back on Infowars in January 2022 again comparing Covid vaccines to the Holocaust. “We don’t want to get down the road where they’re lining us up and putting us in concentration camps” Bigtree said. He asserted that US public health officials “need this pandemic…to be deadly so they can take away all our rights.” He continued: “Our government is lying to us. They’re poisoning us. They’re no longer working for us. They’re probably working for a global agenda that has nothing to do with us.” In an October 29 2024 interview on Infowars with Jones which occurred while Bigtree was working for Kennedy Bigtree told the conspiracy-monger that he had been informed of plans that would occur on “day one” of the new Trump administration. “There are a lot of people that will have to be replaced” Bigtree said seemingly referring to personnel in US health agencies. He also high-fived Jones. Since Trump picked Kennedy for HHS secretary Bigtree has reportedly worked to help vet and interview candidates for HHS jobs. But Kennedy and Trump’s transition team recently attempted to downplay Bigtree’s role. A Kennedy spokesperson told NBC News last month that Bigtree was never part of the transition and that his “views don’t represent Kennedy or Trump’s administration.”  Bigtree did not respond to inquiries about his involvement with the transition. The Trump transition team also did not respond to questions about Bigtree’s role or Kennedy’s links to far-right figures. Jones did not respond to an inquiry sent to his attorneys. Far-right ties have caused some flak for Kennedy. During his presidential bid last year his wife actress Cheryl Hines told an interviewer that she had instructed her husband to follow rules that include not communicating with Jones. Hines then conceded that Kennedy “doesn’t always” follow her advice. But Kennedy’s links to extremists like Jones appear to fill an important need for him. The person who worked with Kennedy said those associations reflect a combination of ideology and opportunism. “It was not his first choice” the person said. “He ran as a Democrat and then as an independent. He didn’t run as a Republican or a libertarian. He went where he could find a home.”
how trump’s return is pushing the media to self-censor,Two days before Donald Trump was re-elected president he told rallygoers that he wouldn’t mind if somebody shot through a crowd of journalists.

The same weekend Trump called journalist…,2025-01-16T11:00:00Z,www.motherjones.com,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/margaret-sullivan-trump-free-press-interview-abc-defamation/,Tyler Comrie  Two days before Donald Trump was re-elected president he told rallygoers that he wouldn’t mind if somebody shot through a crowd of journalists. Some of his supporters laughed a bit some cheered. It was typical fare. The same weekend Trump called journalists “monsters” and “horrible horrible dishonest people.” In the past he has cheered a journalist shot with a rubber bullet as a “beautiful sight;” he heaped adoration on a candidate who body-slammed a reporter. In 2018 he declared the “fake news” media to be the “enemy of the people.” Trump—as he has made clear again and again—disdains the press. And that hatred has consequences. He has launched legal challenges against outlets whose coverage he deems unfavorable mocked journalists and picked an obsequious Federal Communications Commission nominee ready to help him do as he pleases. So how should journalists and news consumers prepare for another four years of attacks on the free press from Trump and his administration? I called media critic and journalist Margaret Sullivan to get her take. Sullivan who previously worked as the public editor for the New York Times and the media columnist for the Washington Post writes a weekly column for the Guardian and for her Substack “American Crisis.” She is also the executive director of the Craig Newmark Center for Journalism Ethics and Security at Columbia Journalism School. We spoke via Zoom at the end of December.   This interview has been lightly condensed and edited. What are the main threats that the press should be worried about as we head toward a second Trump term? I figured a second term would be worse. A lot of the guardrails are down; he has his own team in place at the FBI and at the Justice Department. But then it started to look even a little worse. ABC News chose to settle with Trump a defamation suit centered on the E. Jean Carroll case against him. It worries me that ABC—which is owned by Disney—did not mount a strong defense. And we’re seeing the results of this I think already: Trump is suing the Des Moines Register for a poll that they did during the campaign that wasn’t favorable to him. But it was a legitimate poll by a very legitimate pollster.  I think one of the things that I really worry about the most is that news organizations are going to self-censor and they’re going to hurt themselves by not having a strong spine and enough courage to say “No we’re going to hold fast here. We’re going to defend our reporters and we’re going to defend our speech and press rights.” Given that news organizations typically do not settle defamation suits like that what do you think is Trump’s intent by filing so many lawsuits against them? It’s always a dubious proposition to put yourself inside Donald Trump’s head—I haven’t wanted to be there honestly. But I think it is an effort to intimidate. Certainly he would love to have one of these cases find its way to the Supreme Court where there is probably some sympathy for changing the precedent that has protected news organizations for a long time. It’s really hard to successfully sue for defamation against a public figure. In order to win that kind of case what has to be proved is reckless disregard for the truth or malicious intent. Journalists may make mistakes and they do make mistakes but they’re not purposefully telling lies. So that has been a really important protection. I’ve had a long career in journalism. I started out typing on a manual typewriter. When I became the editor of my hometown paper in Buffalo New York we had various lawsuits. People love to sue the press. We never settled a single case. And in the whole time I was editor which was almost 13 years we never lost a case. That is because we stood steady. To see that getting diminished it’s really worrisome. Billionaires seem to be increasingly wielding control over the free flow of information that’s critical of Trump. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos who also owns the Washington Post killed that paper’s editorial endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for example; Patrick Soon-Shiong owner of the LA Times reportedly did the same. What did you make of this—were you surprised by their actions or do you think that this is what happens when billionaires run news organizations? I was really surprised. I think it has to do with their billionaire ownership. I don’t think that when the Washington Post was owned by the Graham family that would ever have happened. As for the LA Times it’s odd to see Patrick Soon-Shiong’s moves. I mean he is talking about putting a so-called AI-powered “bias meter” on stories to say this story leans left or right. If I were a journalist at that paper just trying to write stories or write editorials or do my job it would be extremely dispiriting to have the owner intruding that way. There’s no other way to put it: This is interfering with editorial independence. It’s really disturbing.  When I was at the Washington Post which was up until 2022 Bezos really was very hands-off. He allowed the journalists to run the paper. That was great. I think some of that probably had to do with the fact that Marty Baron the legendary editor of the Post at the time was a very strong personality. He didn’t really have any problem keeping Bezos at bay. But in this new era it seems to be a completely different story. I know a lot of people there are really upset. If you could leave and go someplace good you probably would at this point. Do you think that Trump is a unique threat to the press or is there a comparable historic precedent? I thought it was really striking when multiple press freedom groups issued warnings a couple of days after the election. What did you make of that? He’s one of a kind. I think there are plenty of others who could be problematic for the press but Trump is particularly worrisome because of his strong personality because of the way he has this cult-like following. Everyone just seems to sort of accept what he says at face value and because he has made it a part of his persona—part of his political persona—to pursue the press and to threaten the press. Many years ago now he told Lesley Stahl of CBS News that the reason he attacks the press is “to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you.” I think that he has actually been very successful in turning the public—some sections of the public a good chunk of it—against the press. Trust is down. It was down anyway but it’s even further down. I remember when I was at the Post and I was doing some reporting in a very red district of New York state I introduced myself to somebody I was trying to interview and his immediate response was “Oh so fake news right?” I think that’s a very common response now. And I don’t mean to say for one second that I think that you journalists do a perfect job or that they’re completely unbiased—I mean that’s not the case. But the journalists that I know are really trying to do good work and they’re really trying to do their job of being the eyes and ears of the public and hold power to account. Just a couple of days before the election Trump made a comment at a rally saying that he’d be okay with someone shooting through a crowd of journalists. How should people take those comments? Should we take them literally? And even if not what kind of damage does he do by seemingly encouraging violence against journalists? I think that part of what happens when democracies are backsliding—and that is definitely happening in the United States—is that there’s this call to violence not only against journalists but in general. You’ve seen a lot of that from Trump calling for or seeming to support violent acts and that’s a part of his appeal. It’s strange to say but it’s absolutely a part of his message. When he talks about shooting journalists or whatever sort of group he’s going after—and certainly his political rivals he said similar kinds of things about—it’s really troubling.  I don’t think that you have to take it literally to be worried about it. But then again you know Trump himself has been the victim of two assassination attempts. And we’re in a very violent culture—I mean all these school shootings and all of this gun violence. It’s increasingly unleashed by a president who talks that way. I think it’s very concerning. How concerned are you about the failure of the PRESS Act to pass this session of Congress which would have created a federal shield law to protect journalists from being forced to disclose their sources to the government? Do you think Trump will try to force journalists to reveal confidential sources?  Over the years I’ve had various feelings about such a law. But I’ve come to feel we really need a federal shield law so that journalists can protect their sources. The fact that it was stopped—basically by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.)—is really unfortunate. I think that there is going to be an effort to have journalists reveal their sources. I don’t know what’s going to happen in the courts—because the courts have in some cases become populated by people who have been appointed by Trump. The PRESS Act would have helped. I don’t think it’s dead. It’s not going to happen right now but it’s something that we’re going to need. How concerned are you about the role Elon Musk could play in further undermining trust in and facilitating attacks on the media given that he has promoted “citizen journalism” as “vastly superior to legacy media journalism” admitted that X limits the reach of posts with links and allowed election disinformation to run rampant in the so-called “election integrity community” on X? He’s clearly a problematic figure. He’s almost playing the role of a shadow president. He’s at Trump’s side a lot. He seems to influence him a lot.  But there’s no reason he should be so influential. All you have to do is look at what has happened with Twitter—which although it had its faults in the past really did play an important role in terms of being sort of a public square for information. And it’s been very compromised by Elon Musk’s ownership. The squelching of news because posts that have a link to a news story the way that the algorithm or whatever it is that’s at work is elevating the voices of people who lean very far right—in some cases there’s hate speech; in some cases there’s white supremacists or even neo-Nazis running rampant.  When he bought Twitter he was talking about free speech and how he was the ultimate free speech champion. But that has not turned out to be the case. Free speech doesn’t mean that every piece of violence or hateful propaganda should be given a megaphone. Freedom of speech is not freedom of reach. Are there other threats to the press in the Trump era that you think people aren’t paying attention to that they should be?  One of the things that’s always on my mind—and this came up in the Obama administration and then again in the Trump administration—is the use of the Espionage Act to go after leaks.  Reality Winner who leaked an intelligence report about Russian interference in the 2016 election to the Intercept was not a journalist. She was a source. But she got a very harsh prison sentence because the Trump administration wanted to make an example of somebody who had leaked classified information. The information that she leaked was important and she did it—I think it seems—as a patriotic act. Yet she was treated very harshly. I think the use of the Espionage Act is something that worries me a lot. That is a 100-year-old law that was never intended to go after journalists but it has been used to go after sources. And I worry that it will be used to go after journalists too. We’ve seen some of that and I’m afraid that will ramp up. How can media consumers fight back against Trump’s attempts to undermine trust in the press?  First of all they should not tune out. There is a really strong urge I think among people who believe in democracy and who are concerned to say “I just can’t take it. I’m going to just watch Netflix and watch sports and concentrate on my family.” And those things are all fine and I do those too. But I think it’s really important to not tune the news out—to still find news sources that you find credible and believable. I think it’s really important for people to support their local news organizations—whether that’s a local nonprofit whether it’s a radio station whether it’s their local newspaper. And I know people say “Oh my local newspaper is owned by a private equity company I have no desire to support them.” But there’s a push and pull there because part of what you’re supporting is the reporters who are at the city council meeting or the school board meeting. I would say: Stay tuned in support voices and organizations that you think are doing a good job try to nurture and support local journalism and don’t lose heart. Don’t throw up your hands. We have to stay engaged as citizens. It is pretty discouraging right now but there are ways to fight back. The US has had a lot of tough times in the past and has come through them and I hope—and I have some level of confidence that our country our democracy is going to be strong enough to endure these challenges.

Kennedy Jr. about controversial comments they said he had made in the past. And over and over President Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services either denied having said those things or said he wasn’t sure he had said them. So CNN reviewed his comments in context — listening to full recordings of his interviews and poring over one of his books. We found that Kennedy did make some of the comments he denied making or claimed not to remember whether he had made though there was at least one case in which his Wednesday denial was accurate. Here is a look at six of the exchanges Kennedy had with members of the Senate Finance Committee: Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado asked Kennedy “Did you write in your book and I (quote): ‘It’s undeniable that African AIDS is an entirely different disease from Western AIDS.’ Yes or no Mr. Kennedy?” Kennedy responded “I’m not sure.” Facts First: Kennedy did write that word for word in a 2021 book. The sentence cited by Bennet appeared in a Kennedy book called “The Real Anthony Fauci.” It was part of a conspiratorial section in which Kennedy baselessly insinuated that the number of people diagnosed with AIDS in Africa had been inaccurately inflated to enrich people whose organizations get money to help fight the disease on that continent. The book makes clear that Kennedy wasn’t claiming that the science of the disease itself is different among Africans than among Westerners. Rather he was claiming baselessly that it is suspicious that the statistics on the demographics of people with AIDS in Africa — for example the fact that a large percentage of Africans diagnosed with the disease are heterosexual women — are different from the statistics on the demographics of people with AIDS in Western countries. Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia said Kennedy had compared the work of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to “Nazi death camps.” Kennedy said “Senator I don’t believe that I ever compared the CDC to Nazi death camps. I support the CDC.” When Warnock asked him whether he is retracting his statement Kennedy said “I’m not retracting it; I never said it.” Then when Warnock read out a quote in which Kennedy used the words “Nazi death camps” Kennedy said “I was not comparing the CDC to Nazi death camps; I was comparing the injury rate to our children to other atrocities. And I wouldn’t compare of course the CDC to Nazi death camps.” Facts First: Kennedy did compare the CDC to Nazi death camps. He did so in 2013 while baselessly linking vaccines to autism in children. At a 2013 conference for the parents of children with autism an audience member asked Kennedy a question about the CDC and autism (some of the question is inaudible in a low-quality recording of the event). In his response Kennedy told a story about the CDC supposedly turning down a past offer from the “vaccine industry” to remove harmful material from vaccines. Kennedy said “I can’t tell you why they did it” but that he has seen people get caught up in institutional “vortexes” in which they “go to extremes” and make decisions merely to “protect themselves.” He then said “To me this is like Nazi death camps.” He then asked “What happened to these kids?” citing the prevalence of autism in boys. Moments later he returned to his comparison between the Nazis and the CDC’s supposed decisions on vaccines saying “I can’t tell you why somebody would do something like that. I can’t tell you why ordinary Germans participated in the Holocaust.” Bennet asked Kennedy “Did you say that exposure to pesticide causes children to become transgender?” Kennedy responded “No I never said that.” Facts First: Kennedy has not explicitly declared that “exposure to pesticides causes children to become transgender” but he has promoted that unfounded conspiracy theory using slightly different language. As CNN’s KFILE reported in 2023 Kennedy has a history of touting the baseless idea that man-made chemicals in the environment such as a herbicide called atrazine could be making children transgender or gay. To cite just one example Kennedy spoke in a 2023 interview about how atrazine can “chemically castrate and forcibly feminize” frogs and he said without providing any evidence that “if it’s doing that to frogs there’s a lot of other evidence that it’s doing it to human beings as well.” He also said in the interview: “I think a lot of the problems we see in kids and particularly boys it’s probably underappreciated of that how much of that is coming from chemical exposures including a lot of the sexual dysphoria that we’re seeing.” Gender dysphoria (not “sexual dysphoria”) which is often experienced by transgender people is the psychological distress some people feel when there is a difference between their sex assigned at birth and their gender identity. A spokesperson for Kennedy’s unsuccessful 2024 presidential campaign told CNN in 2023: “Mr. Kennedy’s remarks are being mischaracterized. He is not claiming that endocrine disruptors are the only or main cause of gender dysphoria. He is merely suggesting that given copious research on the effects on other vertebrates this possibility deserves further research.” Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota said “In an interview in 2023 and again in 2024 you blamed school shootings on antidepressants. You said and this is a quote ‘There is no time in American history or human history that kids were going to shoot schools and shooting their classmates. It really started happening coterminous with the introduction of these drugs with Prozac and with other drugs.’ So do you believe as you’ve said that antidepressants cause school shootings? This is a — should be a simple question.” Kennedy responded “I don’t think anybody can answer that question; I didn’t answer that question. I said it should be studied along with other potential culprits” mentioning “social media.” Facts First: Kennedy has gone further than merely saying “It should be studied along with other potential culprits.” Though he has indeed repeatedly called for more research into the possibility of a link between antidepressants and school shootings including in the 2023 interview Smith was quoting here he has also lent support to the unfounded notion that there is indeed a link. For example in a 2023 public conversation with tech billionaire Elon Musk Kennedy made his usual call for additional research into “the role of psychiatric drugs in these events” — but then said moments later that there is “tremendous circumstantial evidence that those like SSRIs and benzos and other drugs are doing this.” Smith said to Kennedy “You’ve described Americans who take mental health medications as addicts who need to be sent to wellness farms to recover. Is that what you believe?” Kennedy responded “No of course I didn’t say that anybody should be compelled to do anything.” Smith said “No but you said they should be sent.” Kennedy said “I said it should be available to them. I didn’t say they should be sent.” Verdict: Kennedy was correct here. He didn’t say Americans taking legal mental health medications “should be sent” to the “wellness farms” he had proposed creating. Rather in a 2024 interview he suggested that such rural rehabilitation centers could be used to treat people convicted of drug crimes then said that people seeking to get themselves off of legal medications such as those used to treat depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) could voluntarily go to the centers “if they want to.” Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said that although Kennedy now denies he is anti-vaccine Kennedy said on a 2023 podcast that “no vaccine is safe and effective.” Kennedy responded by asserting that Wyden’s claim has “been repeatedly debunked.” Kennedy continued “That statement that I made on the ‘Lex Fridman Podcast’ was a fragment of the statement. He asked me — and anybody who actually goes and looks at that podcast will see this — he asked me ‘Are there vaccines that are safe and effective?’ And I said to him ‘Some of the live virus vaccines are’ and I said ‘There are no vaccines that are safe and effective’ and I was gonna continue ‘For every person; every medicine has people who are sensitive to them including vaccines.’ He interrupted me at that point.” Kennedy added: “I’ve corrected it many times including on national TV.” Facts First: It’s not true that the claim that Kennedy said “no vaccine is safe and effective” has been “debunked.” As Kennedy acknowledged even in this answer he said in the 2023 interview with Fridman “There’s no vaccine that is you know safe and effective” — a comment in line with years of other comments in which Kennedy expressed anti-vaccine sentiment. It is true he preceded those comments to Fridman by saying “I think some of the live virus vaccines are probably averting more problems than they’re causing.” It’s impossible to fact-check Kennedy’s Wednesday assertion that he would have made a more nuanced claim about vaccine safety and effectiveness had Fridman not “interrupted” him. However a review of the video shows Kennedy had finished his sentence before Fridman interjected; Kennedy had continued with the words “In fact …” Also Kennedy’s interview with Fridman proceeded for more than half an hour after this exchange; Kennedy never added the nuance he now says he wanted to. And in Kennedy’s comments to Fridman immediately after this exchange he criticized the polio vaccine — making a baseless claim that he didn’t know whether it caused more deaths than it averted.
